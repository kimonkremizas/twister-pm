# TwisterPM
A Twitter like android application written in **Java** and **Kotlin**.
Guest users can only read messages and their comments. Registered users can additionally post and filter messages and comments, as well as delete the ones that belong to them.

The data are shown using custom recyclerview adapters and the REST client that was used is **Retrofit 2**.
The app has a **dark mode** implemented as well as swipe gesture. Some UI testing was done using the **Espresso** Framework.
Google **Firebase Authentication** SDK was used for the register, login, password reset and change and email change functionalities, as well as **Firebase Crashlytics** for getting crash report logs.

It was a personal project, part of my 4th semester elective course in Mobile Development.
